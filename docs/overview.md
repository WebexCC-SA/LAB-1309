# Overview

## Learning Objectives

This lab series focuses on building, configuring, and testing Autonomous Webex AI Agents. You'll start by setting up these agents and their knowledge base, enabling them to answer queries from a knowledge repository.

The labs then guide you through creating and managing agent actions using Webex Connect flows, which allow the AI to interact with external APIs and fulfill requests. You'll also learn to configure a voice flow and test the AI agent's functionality by making a phone call.

Finally, the series highlights the AI Assistant feature within the Webex Contact Center. You'll explore how this AI enhances the live agent experience by providing conversation summaries when a call is transferred or disconnected and offering real-time transcriptions to improve clarity and efficiency.
